# Writing-Basic-Queries-T3
I first took a dataset of electric vehicles from Kaggle. Then I processed the basic queries on that dataset. My first query was selecting all the columns and then selecting partial ones using different queries. The next was filtering out number_of_cells between 100 AND 150, then it was top_speed_kmh = '155' OR top_speed_kmh ='170', torque_nm = '300' AND acceleration_0_100_s = '6.4', and the last one was using both like and order by and I used model like '600e%'
order by efficiency_wh_per_km desc.
So this was writing basic queries and using Select Statements.
